# React Lifecycle

## About

We will learn about the component lifecycle of React class components.

Here is a [diagram](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/) noting the lifecycle methods.

**In this demo, we will be going over**:
- `render`
- `useEffect hook in relation to componentDidMount(Class based components)`
- `useEffect hook in relation to componentDidUpdate((Class based components)`
-  `useEffect hook in relation to componentWillUnmount(class based components)`

**Other concepts that we will talk about are**:
- React list items
- Virtual DOM
- `root.render()` vs. `return statement render`

For this demo, we will be using [`Pokemon API`](https://pokeapi.co/). This will help us generate a RESTful API to fetch data and use it in our applicaiton

## To Run

Fork and clone this repo and `npm install` just a disclaimer: I highly encouraged that you `git checkout end` to get the end point and follow along while taking notes instead of trying to type along with me from the starting point.

Then run, `npm run dev`
